# CS 188: Data Science Fundamentals

#### Project 1: Airbnb
- Packages: sklearn (pipeline, preprocessing, linear_model), numpy, matplotlib, pandas
- Coded complete data pipeline using sklearn to scale numerical features and one hot encode categorical features
- Imputed missing features or values
- Fitted linear regression model to data to predict price

#### Project 2: Binary Classification Comparative Methods
- Packages: sklearn (svm, linear_model, neighbors, tree, cluster, metrics), seaborn, pandas
- Classified people as having heart disease or not having heart disease based on several factors
- Trained models on raw and processed data to compare performance
- Trained several models based on different methods: linear SVM, logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors
- Reported accuracy, precision, recal, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- Plotted ROC curve

#### Project 3: Predicting Taxi Ride Duration
- Packages: sklearn, keras
- Find the best regression model that predicts the travel time of a taxi ride in New York
  - Simple linear regression
  - Tree (finding different model for each combination of features)
  - Built own neural network classifier 
- Performed PCA on pick-up location (longitude and latitude)
